<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  We want you to feel welcome here! Our Lord's day service looks something like this: We sing to God, we confess our sin together and hear God's pardon, we pray together, we read the scriptures together, and we are commissioned to go and serve the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
  We usually observe communion the first week of each month. We practice "open communion", that means any Christian of like faith is welcome to take the elements irrespective of your church membership after appropriate <a href="https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=532463465">self examination</a>.
